# dataset-generate
Python script to generate random features and corresponding properly computed labels. This is a basic implementation of dataset generation.
This script also splits the generated CSV dataset into two datasets as features and labels.
This makes it easier for almost any Machine Learning code to predict the label when the features are fed.
